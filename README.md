### A website designed in Grade 9 Exploring Technology (TIJ101) 

This website grew on skills I learned from my previous websites. Here I learned the importance of using javascript frameworks and implemented three.js into my website. 

I used three.js for the introduction page, where I loaded a 3D model of my fake product's soda can rotating around.
